// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers


Start		
Read num1   
Read num2   
	Set sum = num1 + num2  
		Display sum  
			End


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Start
Read number    
IF number modulo 2 is equal to 0 then
	Display "The number is even"
 Else
	Display "The number is odd"
		End

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


Start
Read num1    
Read num2   
Read num3    
Read num4
Read num5
Set sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5   
Set average = sum / 5   
Set minimum = minimum of num1, num2, num3, num4, num5    
Set maximum = maximum of num1, num2, num3, num4, num5   
Display "Average: " + average   
Display "Minimum: " + minimum    
Display "Maximum: " + maximum   
	 End
